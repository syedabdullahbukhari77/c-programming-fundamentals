   Demonstrates different data types in C (int, float, double, char) and their storage sizes.  

4. **04_constants.c**  
   Introduction to constants (`const` keyword) and why immutability matters.

## âš¡ How to Compile & Run

Using **GCC**:  
```bash
gcc 01_hello_world.c -o hello
./hello


## How to Compile & Run
Using GCC:
```bash
gcc 01_hello_world.c -o hello
./hello
```

Windows (Dev-C++ / TDM-GCC):
```
gcc 01_hello_world.c -o hello.exe
hello.exe```
